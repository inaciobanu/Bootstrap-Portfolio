# Bootstrap-Portfolio Challenge

## My Task

Welcome to my third Bootcamp Challenge! In this assignment, we had to build our portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from scratch.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements and items required:

* A navigation bar
* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
* Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
* A hero section
* A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
* A work section
* A section displaying your work in grid.
* Use Bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work. Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
* A skills section. List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
* An about/contact section
* An About Me section in the same row.
* A footer section. All hyperlinks should have a hover effect. All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
* Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
* Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Outcomes

I was required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application is [Here](https://inaciobanu.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/)

* The URL of the GitHub repository that contains my code is [Here](https://github.com/inaciobanu/Bootstrap-Portfolio).
